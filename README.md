# healthy-worker
A Python Program that helps to take care of health while working.

Our health is the most valuable gift we are given so, we must maintain it.
Many of us have very unhealthy working habits(including me) that can cause serious damage to our health.
In order to prevent this from happening I have created a program that will remind you to take small breaks and do some activities like a bit of movement, drink water and exercise for eyes.

An audio will start playing when the time will come and to stop it you have to type some keywords which are mentioned in the program.
And this will repeat till you close the program.

All the time you will stop the alarm/music some data will get appended to a .txt file named 'log.txt', the data will include: What activity you have done and at which time, date, day and year.
